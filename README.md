# 🏀 HoopTrack

**Automated player and ball tracking system for professional basketball using Computer Vision and Deep Learning.**  
Tactical decisions and statistical insights in professional basketball require accurate player and ball tracking. **HoopTrack** is a computer vision pipeline built to detect players, track their trajectories, rectify positions onto a standard basketball court, and identify the ball handler.

> ⚠️ Note: This project was built with a mix of traditional computer vision and deep learning techniques. Performance was not the primary goal, but rather experimentation and proof of concept.
